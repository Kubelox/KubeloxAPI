KubeloxAPI
==========

Kubelox API is a [Bukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit/CraftBukkit) plugin that serves no purpose on it's own.
It's purpose is to serve as a reference point for other plugins in the [Kubelox](http://www.kubelox.com) library.

Other KubeloxAPI dervived plugins will NOT work (or load at all) without the API being present.

Upon the KubeloxAPI being at a successfully working stage, with a good amount of library plugins, we will be opening Pull Requests for everyone where we will except contributions.

All people who contribute a decent amount towards the Kubelox project will get a special rank on and around the Kubelox network.

Developers
----------

Clearly KubeloxAPI is going to be on an ongoing project which will update constantly as and when we add more plugins or Minecraft/Bukkit itself updates to break stuff.

This is why we are gathering a team of highly trained monkeys, won't be the first time I refer to that very bad and stolen phrase, to help with this project.

You will be required to have a decent knowledge of Java as a language, and a varying amount of knowledge with Bukkit plugins as a whole.

We will not slow you down or hurry you up:
You will be able to pick what you want to do (with some restrictions),
You can work at what ever speed you want (slow or fast).

Server Owners
-------------

Do you own a server? Are you interested in using Kubelox? Well then I'm dissappointed to have to tell you that it is not complete as of yet.

Kubelox will offer a service like no other, the abiliy to create a fully functional server through our website. You will be able to with one button click, add a plugin to your server. All the configurations are a case of tick boxes on a page, and all plugins are very well documentated!

If you are interested in using Kubelox once released, or just want more answers then email me:

Frequently asked questions: (Formally known as FAQ's)
---------------------------

Q: Will other bukkit plugins work with Kubelox?

A: The simple answer is some will and some won't. Kubelox from an API standpoint as well as it's library of plugins are designed to interlink with each other, and to work perfectly coinciding. Other plugins will obviously work with the server as we will not be putting any precautions to stop other plugins - but we can not be held responsible for them not working 100% for them clashing with out plugins. Any plugins that require permissions to work will not work as all our permissions will be stored internally and won't work with outside plugins.

Q: Is MySQL required?

A: Yes, Most of our plugins will rely on an extensive use of MySQL to store all the information efficiently and easily. This is one way of all our plugins working together and a good way of us making it easy to alter your server configurations by storing them in a database rather than in an array of files.

Q: Will there ever be a file based version? (Rather than MySQL)

A: I don't want to say no, but with the increasing support for MySQL throughout the Bukkit community - I do find it hard to understand why we would go through the added stress of making a file version. So the answer is going to be possibly, if the demand is high enough.

Q: How do I setup my server to use Kubelox?

A: It's pretty simple in the whole scheme of things, Little knowledge is required and if you honestly don't have a clue how to set it up after reading the extensive written support - then you can get on the support line and one of our helpful staff will take you from start to finish.
